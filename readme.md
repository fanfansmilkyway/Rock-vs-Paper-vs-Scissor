# Rock vs Paper vs Scissor
    This is a game which simulates the Rock vs Paper vs Scissor. But we don't really play it(We don't randomly choose:joy:).  
    Instead, we put rocks, papers, scissors on the canvas and let them fight with each other. Unfortunately, I am not good at AI technology so actually they just randomly move in straight line, and bounce if they hit the wall. When they "fight"(it means one touches another), for example, if a rock meets a paper, the rock dies, but paper are still alive, and a new paper will be born. Very simple, right?
